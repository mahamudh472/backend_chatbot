The History of Acme Corp

Founded in 2010 by engineers Alice Williams and Bob Johnson, Acme Corp started in a small garage with a mission to simplify technology for everyday life.

Our first product, the "AutoButton," was a simple smart home controller. While not a major commercial success, it established our reputation for build quality.

The breakthrough came in 2015 with the launch of the original SynthoGizmo, a health and fitness tracker that garnered critical acclaim for its accurate sensors and long battery life.

Today, headquartered in San Francisco, Acme Corp employs over 500 people and continues to innovate in the consumer electronics and software space, staying true to its founding principle: "Tech, Simplified."
